# LaTeX On Screen Keyboard
This is a program written in Python which aims to make typing LaTeX commands a lot less cumbersome. Based on a dictionary in the `main.py` file which links LaTeX commands to symbols, buttons are dynamically added onto the screen; when pressed, they insert LaTeX commands corresponding to their symbols onto the window's textbox.

You can also search for specific symbols and a toggle is available to keep the window on the top of the screen (for easy switching to and from the OSK).

Only includes math symbols for now. More to come soon!
